# The --noreload option is necessary because of the handling of the TileStache
# server. Without this option, because we use 'manage.py runserver' and not
# wsgi.py, some initialisation tasks are done twice by Django. More
# specifically, the server TileStache is run twice which leads to an error the
# second time.
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --noreload
